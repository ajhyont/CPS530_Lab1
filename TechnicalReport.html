				<h2 style="padding-top: 5vh;">The New tag that I tried:</h2>
				<p>The new tag I used was the 'cite' tag. It is useful only to highlight and reference a body of work worth citing in the html content. It is mostly for semantic value than anything else.</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top: 5vh;">Difference I saw in using this site on various browsers:</h2>
				<p>chrome: The borwser used for develping the site to begin with. Everything is working fine on it and is chosen as the baseline to compare to.
					Edge: All links and display characteristics are same as chrome. Only noteworthy difference is in the scrolling experience which is not as smooth on the website as it is on chrome. But that's the custom
					scrolling effect in Edge.
					Safari: Safari no longer supports Windows....
					Firefox: firefox was the fastest amongt all the borwers used when it came to processing the website
					onto the screen. It also give the website more of an edge-less feel. Unlike with other browsers, I can 
					see the edge of the navbar on firefox. It is interesting because I set navbar's width to 100%. In chrome, 
					the navbar continues across the screen despite the amonut of zoom-in/aoom-out.
					Internet Explorer: Internet explorer does not allow zooming out via trackpad, I had to use 'ctrl -' 
					to zoom out, which was strange. otherwise, the website looks similar to the version in chrome except
					i think the header text is slightly smaller.
					samsung Galaxy s8+(on samsung's internet app): At default zoom setting, everything looks and works like
					in chrome. But if zoomed, The navbar stops being "sticky" and navbar background-color fails to extend
					across the dsiplay, a similar problem to that seen in firefox.</p>
